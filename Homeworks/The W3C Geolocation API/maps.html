<!--
1. Prompt the user to allow the use of Geolocation API.
2. If the user allows the API, use the Google maps API
   to display a large map of their current area, with
   a pin on their exact location.
3. If the user doesn't allow the API, display an error
   message on the page instead.

Extra Credit:
Instead of showing a pin of their current location,
show the user driving directions from their current
location to the nearest library.
