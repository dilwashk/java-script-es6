/*
 * Homework #14: Callbacks and Promises
 * Keeping Up With the Javascripts - Part 1: ES6
 * Pirple
 * 

 */

/*
 * Create two different scripts. One will contain the callback-centered code, and the other the promises-centered code.
 * The two scripts should contain the same functionality, and solve the same problems.
 * 
 * Each script should expose a function that accepts one argument: an integer between 1 and 1000 called "num".
 * When that function is called, the following steps should happen for "num" in order:
 * 
 * 1. Calculate the square of num and log it to the console
 * 2. Wait "num" milliseconds
 * 3. Calculate the square root of num and log it to the console
 * 4. Determine the prime-number that is closest to num without being greater than or equal to num, and then log it to the console
 * 5. Count the total elapsed time from when the original function was called until the last step was completed, and log that to
 *    the console as well.
